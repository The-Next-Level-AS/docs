# Canine Cuisine

<br />

In this example, we'll set up an NXTL-instance that will **manifest as a website** providing **information on dog food** (“Canine Cuisine”) in a way that **dynamically adapts** to the individual user.

The goal is to fascilitate individualization across **types of dog owners** and **their dogs’ needs**. Since we're dealing with a **large variety** of **dog breeds**, individualization becomes a **complex issue**. Were we to solve this **manually**, we'd have to create **a lot** of specialized user interfaces, as well as make sure users were **correctly matched up** with the optimal interface.

With NXTL, this kind of individualization is **automated** and **abstracted** away. We can concentrate on **higher level** matters like: mapping out the **user journeys**, connecting the **right datasets**, and specifying the **signals** that we want to pick up from the user in order to serve them their **generative user experiences**.

## Preparing datasets and integrations

We have two datasets on hand:

- A set of articles on the topics of canine **health** and **diets**
- A dataset of **dog breeds**

Furthermore, we have access to an **ecommerce-API** providing affiliate links to popular dog food products.

## Specifying user journeys

In doing research, we've identified **three fundamental user journeys**, covering the distinct needs and interactions of various user types:

- **New** dog owners seeking **information**
- **Existing** dog owners looking for **alternatives**
- **Health-conscious** owners seeking **specialized** diets
