# Canine Cuisine

<br />

In this example, we'll set up an NXTL-instance that will **manifest as a website** providing **information on dog food** (“Canine Cuisine”) in a way that **dynamically adapts** to the individual user.

The goal is to fascilitate individualization across **types of dog owners** and **their dogs’ needs**. Since we're dealing with a **large variety** of **dog breeds**, individualization becomes a **complex issue**. If we were to solve this **manually**, we'd have to create **a lot** of specialized user interfaces, as well as make sure users were **correctly matched up** with the optimal interface.

With NXTL, this kind of individualization is **automated** and **abstracted** away. We can concentrate on **higher level** matters like: mapping out the **user journeys**, connecting the **right datasets**, and specifying the **signals** that we want to pick up from the user in order to serve them their **generative user experiences**.

We start by creating a **new project** from the NXTL dashboard:

This launches the **Project dashboard** view:

## Adding data sources

We have two datasets on hand:

- A set of articles on the topics of canine **health** and **diets**
- A dataset of **dog breeds**

Furthermore, we have access to an **ecommerce-API** providing means of creating our own affiliate links to popular dog food products.

To start adding data, we click **Add data source**, which launches the **Data source dialog**.

The article dataset consists of one hundred Markdown-formatted (.md) files. We drag-and-drop those in, give the data source a **unique** name (like `dog_articles`) and click **Submit**:

<br />
<div className="img">
  [TODO: Screenshot of **Data source dialog** for article dataset]
</div>

NXTL will now proceed to **process** the dataset in the background. We will be **notified** when it is ready. In the **meantime**, we can continue adding data.

Next up is the dog breeds dataset. This comes in the form of an SQL-database dump. We click **Add data source** again, drag-and-drop our file, name the data source `dog_breeds` and submit:

<br />
<div className="img">
  [TODO: Screenshot of **Data source dialog** for dog breeds dataset]
</div>

Finally, we add the API-integration by clicking **Add data source**. We name it `dog_food_links` and fill out the **API-related fields**, before submitting:

<br />
<div className="img">
  [TODO: Screenshot of **Data source dialog** for API-integration]
</div>

We now have all our data sources in place, and can keep track of them from the **Data sources** dashboard pane:

## Specifying user journeys

In doing our dog food research, we've identified **three fundamental user journeys**, covering the distinct needs and interactions of various user types:

- **New** dog owners seeking **information**
- **Existing** dog owners looking for **alternatives**
- **Health-conscious** owners seeking **specialized** diets

To set up our first user journey, we click **Add user journey** from the **Project dashboard**. This will launch the **User journey dialog**:

<br />
<div className="img">[TODO: Screenshot of **User journey dialog**]</div>

We name our user journey `new_dog_owner` and add a brief description:

<br />
<div className="img">
  [TODO: Screenshot of **User journey dialog** with fields filled out]
</div>

We will proceed to specify the **parts** that make up this user journey.

Each discrete part of a user journey represents the potential for a **user interface**. We specify them in the form of **output matrices**. These are the templates from which NXTL ultimately produces **individualized user experiences** based on **user signals** and **retrieved data**.

An **output matrix** template can target **any output that is expressible in text or code**. In our case, the artifacts we want to produce are websites, i.e. HTML code.

We click **Add an output matrix**, which launches a separate dialog:
