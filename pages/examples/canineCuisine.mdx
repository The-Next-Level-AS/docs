# Canine Cuisine

<br />

In this example, we'll set up an NXTL-instance that will **manifest as a website** providing **information on dog food** (“Canine Cuisine”).

## Preparing datasets and integrations

We have two datasets on hand:

- A set of articles on the topics of canine **health** and **diets**
- A dataset of **dog breeds**

Furthermore, we have access to an ecommerce-API providing affiliate links to popular dog food products.

## Specifying user journeys

In our research phase, we've identified **three fundamental user journeys**, covering the distinct needs and interactions of various user types:

- **New** dog owners seeking **information**
- **Existing** dog owners looking for **alternatives**
- **Health-conscious** owners seeking **specialized** diets
