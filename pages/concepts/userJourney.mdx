# User Journey

<br />

A "user journey" refers to the series of **steps** or **interactions** a **user** goes through when engaging with a **product** or **service**, e.g. a digital user experience.

Defining a set of user journeys for a product or service means taking into account **business goals** as well as **user needs** and **contextual factors** (experience level, time of day, geographical location, etc.).

NXTL provides a **structured approach** to encapsulating these **insights** and dealing with user journeys in **well-defined terms**, in turn making them act as **blueprints** for **individualized user experiences**.
