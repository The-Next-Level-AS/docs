# Matrices & Artifacts

<br />

In NXTL, each **discrete part** of a user journey is specified in the form of a **matrix**, which is the **template** from which NXTL ultimately produces **instances** of individualized user experience, or: **artifacts**.

A **matrix** can target **anything that is expressible in text or code** as its artifact, like a website, a document, a poem, a game, etc.
