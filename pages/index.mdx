## What is NXTL?

NXTL is a platform for enabling **“next-level”** digital user experiences.

**What do we mean by this?**

By nature, conventional digital UX is stuck at a **low level** of individualization. One should think that user experiences in the digital age had progressed further. Disappointingly, outside of algorithmic feeds and recommendation engines, the status quo is a **one-size-fits-all** approach, where personalization is sacrificed for the convenience of a common denominator.

Any valuable insights garnered from user research are likely to be wasted on digital products that ultimately **collapse into compromise and convention**.

One could say that **digital inclusivity** is not provided in a meaningful sense.

**This is the problem we want to solve.**

The NXTL platform offers a **level of abstraction** over digital user experiences, where **user journeys** are encapsulated in well-defined terms and instantiated as **individualized user experiences**, generated dynamically with the help of **artificial intelligence**.

NXTL is generative UI.
